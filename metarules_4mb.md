# 4MB Jam Metarules
These are the rules about rules for the 4MB Jam. Along with [this other document](roles_4mb.md), they are part of the operational rules of the 4MB Jam. The metarules are written with the [ideological mission](https://4mbjam.dev/mission/) of the jam in mind.
1. The Jam rules may not allow games that are 4MiB or over in size after extraction on the disk.
    1. The Jam rules may allow exceptions for executable packers.
    2. The Jam rules may allow exceptions for non game files like readmes and licences, or any file that is not used at runtime.
    3. Judge Council rulings may add specific or generic exceptions to this rule but they may not be used by the Host or Judges as a way to circumvent the rule and those exceptions have to be justified.
2. The duration of the jam should always be 31 days.
3. The jam is first and foremost intended for the desktop. A Host may want to add support for other platforms, but they cannot remove support for Windows and Linux.
    1. The supported Linux distro should be a distro that is, by general consensus on the internet, the recommended beginner friendly distro. Currently, this is Linux Mint.
    2. Other desktop Operating Systems may be supported, but only ones that are credible daily drivers. Currently, those are MacOS and FreeBSD.
        1. SteamOS is not intended to be a desktop operating system as it cannot be installed on neither a laptop nor desktop computer, being only used for handhelds. Addintionally it behaves as a console by default. Until those things change, it cannot be considered nor be treated as a desktop OS.
    3. Some modern game consoles and mobile platforms are ok too. Currently those are: SteamDeck, Switch 2, Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, Android and iOS.
    4. The web browser is never going to be allowed as a platform.
    5. Retro game consoles and fantasy consoles are never going to be allowed as a platform.
    6. The jam rules should always be specific about which versions of the supported platforms are allowed.
    7. The jam rules may allow for unsupported platforms and redundant platforms that aren't evaluated alongside the main platforms.
4. The jam rules may not be modified while the jam is ongoing.
    1. Instead, the Host should seek a ruling from the Judge Council if there is a situation that really warrants it.
    2. However, typoes can be fixed and incorrect examples corrected. 
    3. The community should be notified on both Discord and Itch if a ruling is made or a rule is changed in any way, even if it's just fixing a typo.
5. There will always be a community award which is decided by community vote using one form or another of [IRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting).
6. Games must be evaluated by judges and the average total score from those evaluations decide the winners.
    1. Games must be evaluated following at least 3 criteria; gameplay, size and theme.
    2. Games must be evaluated by at least 3 separate judges.
    3. There may be alternative solutions for deciding winners in the case of very close or equal scores. Some entries may also be uneligible to win by rule or ruling.
7. There must be a theme.
