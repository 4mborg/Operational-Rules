# Roles Within the 4MB Jam Organisation
These are the definitions, rules, responsabilities and obligations related to the roles of the 4MB Jam. Along with [this other document](metarules_4mb.md), they are part of the operational rules of the 4MB Jam.
## The Organizers
The organisers are the Host, the Admin and the Owner. Their chief concern is to implement the [core mission of the 4MB Jam](https://4mbjam.dev/mission/).
* The Owner owns the 4MB Jam Organisation, website and the platform the 4MB Community uses to hang out and chat (the 4MB Jam discord group).
    + Is responsible for finding a Host and an Admin.
        - Ideally, the choice is then validated by the community. 
    + Pays for the website.
    + Writes the operational rules of the jam.
    + Handles monetary transactions in regards to the prize pool and donations from sponsors.
* The Administrator takes charge of the administrative side of the jam;
    + Writes and clarifies the discord rules.
    + Listens to feedback from the community about changes on the discord.
    + Is the chief enforcer of the rules of the discord group, which apply to both the discord and the itch forums of a 4MB Jam event.
    + Is the chief enforcer of the rules of a 4MB Jam event.
    + Is the chief maintainer of the website.
    + Is responsible for recruiting their staff; website devs, moderators, etc.
    + Collaborates with the Host and tries to solve administrative problems and the needs the Host of the jam may have.
    + Has to ensure that the community always has a working backup platform in case Discord dies or becomes otherwise unusable by most (which is a dormant Revolt server for now)
    + The Admin is responsible for collecting the data of the community award vote and applying the IRV system to the vote. The results are then communicated to the Host.
    + The Admin must consult the community on big decisions that drastically change the way the community operates, unless it is to move the community to the backup platform in case Discord dies.
    + The Admin is free to delegate some of their responsibilities.
* The Host is the one in charge of the event side of the jam;
    + Hosts a jam at least once every two years, but no more than twice per year.
    + Decides what the theme is, but may consult the Judge Council, the community or both.
    + Is responsible for making the itch page of the Jam.
    + Is responsible for kickstarting the prize pool and seeking one or more sponsorships, but lets the Owner handle the actual transactions.
    + Decides how the prize money is split amongst the winners.
        - Note: The judge council may produce a ruling that overrides the Host's decision. 
    + The Host must be capable of implementing a sponsor's demands if any and if they cannot, then the sponsorship must be declined. For example, if the Sponsor asks to have their banner put on the itch.io page or to leave a word about them in the announcement channel of the discord, this is easily implementable within the confines of the Host's powers. Even putting something on the website, since the website team's only client is the Host, could be done. But if the sponsor asks for a special role colour on discord, which falls under the direction of the Admin, then the Host can try to ask the Admin to implement that demand, but the Admin is very much within their rights to refuse that demand.
    + As the Head Judge, the Host is responsible for writing the jam rules that pertain to what is allowed and disallowed in the jam, which platforms are supported, exceptions to the rules, the evaluation criteria, the categories, etc.
        - Note: The Host cannot change the operational rules of the jam. The jam rules cannot go against the guarantees of the metarules.
    + As the Head Judge, the Host is responsible for summoning the attention of the judge council on issues that require rulings during the jam. They act as their speaker when a decision is made by the council.
        - If the Host wants to allow late entries, then they are obligated to consult the judges on whether to allow late entries or not as well as under which conditions late entries are admitted, if the concil decides that they are allowed.
    + As the Head Judge, the Host is responsible for recruiting judges.
    + As the Head Judge, the Host is responsible for assigning game evaluations to individual judges and make sure each game is evaluated as per the operational rules.
    + As the Head Judge, the Host has all the same responsibilities as other judges.
    + As the Social Media Manager, the Host is responsible for the social media account(s) of the jam, not including the discord server itself.
    + As the Marketing Director, the Host is responsible for advertising the jam.
    + As the Community Manager, the Host is responsible for notifying the community of the theme reveal, deadlines, results, rulings and other such things warranting an announcement to the community.
    + As the Community Manager, the Host updates the rules of the event in reaction to what happened to previous iterations and also from community feedback.
    + As the Graphic Designer, the Host creates or modifies the logos, banners, certificates and other such graphics required for the jam if and when deemed necessary.
    + The Host is free to delegate some of their responsibilities.

_**Note: There is no such thing as a Head Judge, Community Manager, Marketing Director, Graphic Designer, etc. Those roles are named and divided in such a fashion in order to make it easier for the Host to delegate their tasks.**_
## Event Staff
The event staff are appointed by the Host and are under their direction. The event staff are comprised of the Judge Council and the Delegates.
### Judge Council
The judge council has at least 3 judges in total (1 Head Judge, usually the Host, and 2 regular judges). There are 3 types of judges:
* The Head Judge, who is also typically the Host. The responsibilities of the Head Judge are detailed in the [above section](#the-organizers).
* The Judge:
    + Produces advice for the rules of the jam prior to its start when prompted by the Head Judge (optional).
    + Produces an opinion which will help form the basis of a ruling during the jam when prompted by the Head Judge or naturally when a situation arises that brings the conversation about an issue with the interpretation of the rules. As an entity, the Judge Council emits rulings that affect the course of a jam in regards to the interpretation of the rules if they are unclear or supposed unclear and other issues such as how to handle the late submission period or rankings that are so close that the numbers that are different are in some position after the decimal (like 10.9992 and 10.9991 for example), etc. Rulings that the Judge Council emit _cannot_ be overturned nor overruled by the Head Judge/Host.
    + Evaluates the games assigned to them.
* The Backup Judge is like a normal judge, but they only evaluate games. Typically appointed last minute when there's an emergency.
### Event Delegate
An event delegate is someone who is charged with part of one or more of the responsibilities of the Host and only the Host (judges and event delegates may not delegate their responsibilities). In order to clear confusion on what the delegate is doing, there should be a clear label on what their role is within the organisation of the event, with a discord role on them so that they can be easily identified by their role.

To understand where we're going with this terminology, we can look at the definition of the word "delegate" on Wiktionary:
1. Delegate: "A person authorized to act as representative for another; a deputy."
2. Deputy: "One appointed as the substitute of others, and empowered to act for them, in their name or their behalf; a substitute in office."

Thus a delegate is a representative of the Host, empowered to act for them on their behalf. Ultimately what that means in 4MB Jam terms is that when a delegate makes a mistake, the Host is also responsible for that mistake.
## Administrative Staff
The administrative staff are appointed by the Administrator and are under their direction. The Administrative staff has 3 branches; the Itch Moderation Team, the Discord Moderation Team and the Website Team.
* The Itch Moderation Team is in charge of enforcing the rules of the jam and the rules of the discord community within the itch forums and the comment sections of game entries.
    + They are the first to try the games and make sure they follow the rules and rulings of the jam. If a game is deemed to not follow the jam rules, the itch moderator disqualifies the entry and records it in the public spreadsheet.
        - While the jam is ongoing and there is still time left, the moderator should leave a message on the entry page explaining why it was disqualified unless it is obvious spam. If the participant completely fixes all the issues with their entry before the submission period runs out, then their entry must be requalified without penalty. If the submission period was over, the participant has 48 hours to fix the issue and no longer.
        - The moderation team may at any point relinquish its responsibility to disqualify one or many entries and instead seek a ruling from the Judge Council, which they must implement once received (if it requires an action on their part). Seeking the ruling is obligatory if half or more entries violate one or more of the same rules in what seems to be a misunderstanding.
        - Pure spambot trash should be outright removed from the jam instead of disqualified.
    + Responsible for making sure games work. Participants may forget to include a dependency, may not provide information about required settings or setups, may use an archive format that requires a program not installed by default (like rar or 7zip), may provide the source code instead of a binary, etc. Therefore, the Itch Moderation Team collaborates with the Judge Council when there are issues running the games and may even have to repackage some entries.
    + Collaborates with the Discord Moderation Team in case there are rulebreakers who are active on both platforms.
        - A strike on one platform is a strike on both platforms; if a rulebreaker is told not to repeat something under threat of ban on Discord, but they do it on Itch anyway (or vice versa), then they are banned from both platforms.
        - If there are participants whose entries were disqualified and they seem mad about it, the Discord Moderation Team should be alerted to that fact.
* The Discord Moderation Team is in charge of enforcing the rules of the discord community within the discord server.
    + Collaborates with the Itch Moderation Team in case there are rulebreakers who are active on both platforms.
* The Website Team, under the lead of the Admin, is in charge of maintaining and developing the website according to the needs and vision of the Host.
